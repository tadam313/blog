Welcome to a mind of a developer ([@tadam313]({{ site.author.twitter }})). Honestly, I've never wanted to start a blog. I thought it is just a desperate attempt from people to be someone "special", someone unique in the crowd. Then someday I realised, I just put off myself and didn't have anything to write about. There were some moments recently, some special moments when I felt like *hey, actually it is a pretty nice idea, maybe it's worth sharing with the world*. When I had this feeling n times I decided not to get by and start blogging about them.

Yeah, pretty much it, I've just taken this handy suggestion and started it. But what was the point what is this whole thing really about? Well, broadly speaking this blog leads you right onto the tangled routes running across my mind. It is a technical blog filled with all my crazy ideas and fictions.

OK, don't be scared it won't be that much nerdy. Just a bit.

Couple of words about me. Currently I'm working as a Javascript developer. Your guess is probably correct, this is also my favourite language. Beside it, sometimes I need to touch elsewhere to deal with other technologies, it is unavoidable, it is the life of an engineer. You need to solve problems, problems still not exists, problems from another domain, problems everywhere. Here is my thing: **LANGUAGE IS JUST A TOOL**. Heard that right, all that matters is the mindset and attitude. Although language can shape how people think about specific problem it can even help writing more compact and cleaner code for specific problems but without critical thinking that is all empty at the end. In my point of view mindset is something which could transform a developer into an engineer.

OK now, what is this blog about? Just another JS blog with all that trendy-fancy JS frameworks and browser stuff?

No, not entirely at least. The majority of the content might written for JS but I am planning to get through a different message here. **IDEAS**. Yeah, this blog is about ideas. Ideas that might surprise you, ideas that are remarkable and ideas that maybe add some novelty to the community. I don't want to extend your head with useless and stale stories abusing the whole point of blogging. Transmit something new, that is my purpose, something stunning that adds value to our life instead of bore everybody down.

If you still can not live with JS I am planning to make the posts versatile enough. When such a nice idea crosses my mind I share it regardless the technology and context I promise. Deal?

I read somewhere that every blogger should have a great muse which encourages to generate content day by day and make proclaiming the brain from the housetop. Well, I think mine is software engineering. Sounds geeky, I know, blame me if you want, but the truth always boils down to the fact `This is a lifestyle, not a job`.
