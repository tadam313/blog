Welcome to a mind of a developer ([@tadam313](http://twitter.com/tadam313)). Honestly, I've never wanted to start a blog. I thought it is a desperate attempt from people to be someone "special" rather than just the plain boring someone. Someday I realized I just didn't have anything to write about. Recently There were some moments, some special moments when I felt like *hey, actually it is a pretty nice idea, maybe it's worth sharing with the world*. When I had this feeling n times I decided not to get by but start blogging about them. How?

> "The secret of getting ahead is getting started." - Mark Twain

Yeah, pretty much it, I've just taken Twain suggestion and started it. But what is it really about? Well, broadly speaking this blog leads you right onto that tangled routes running across my mind. Just kidding, it will be a technical blog filled with all my crazy ideas and such things.

Ok, don't be scared it won't be that much nerdy. Just a bit. Couple of words about me: currently I'm working as a Javascript developer. Your guess is probably correct, that is also my favourite language. Of course, sometimes I need to touch other technologies but here is the thing: **LANGUAGE IS JUST A TOOL**. All that matters is the mindset. Yeah, language can shape how people think about specific problem it can even help writing more compact and clean code but without critical thinking that is all empty at the end. In my point of view mindset is the thing which could transform a developer into an engineer.

OK now, what is this blog about? Just another JS blog with all that trendy-fancy JS frameworks and browser stuff?

No, not entirely at least. The majority of the content might written around JS but I am planning to get through a different message here. **IDEAS**. Yeah, this blog is about ideas. Ideas that might surprise you, ideas that are new and ideas that maybe add some value to the community. I don't want to extend your head with useless and stale stories because that makes the whole point of blogging. Transmit something new, something stunning that adds value to our life instead of bore everybody down.

If you still can not live with JS I am planning to make the posts versatile enough. When such a nice idea crosses my mind I share it regardless the language and technology I promise. Deal?

I read somewhere that every blogger should have a great niche which encourage her to generate content day by day and proclaim the mind from the housetop. Well, I think mine is software development itself. Sounds geeky, I know, blame me if you want, but the truth always boils down: `It is a lifestyle, not a job`.
