Welcome to a mind of a developer ([@tadam313]({{ site.author.twitter }})). Honestly, it was never really my intention to start a blog but someday I realized, I just put off myself and didn't have anything to write about. There were some moments recently, some special moments when I felt like *hey, actually it is a pretty nice idea, maybe it's worth sharing with someone*. When I had this feeling nth times I decided not to pass by and start blogging about them.

Yeah, pretty much it, I've just taken this handy suggestion and went for it. But what is the point what is this whole thing really about? Well, broadly speaking this blog leads you right onto the tangled paths running across my mind. It is a technical blog filled with all my crazy ideas and fictions.

OK, don't be scared it won't be that much nerdy. Just a bit.

A couple of words about me. Currently, I'm working as a software engineer in the UK, Scotland. What am I doing? Well, solving problems, software problems, problems you don't know about, problems you don't want to know about and problems not even exist. Do I have a life? I'd like to think, yes :) Outside working hours I love to watch movies, hitting the strings of my guitar, having short excursions and weekend gateways.

Ok, so what is this blog about? **IDEAS**. Really don't expect too much story telling or casual everyday life reporting I won't bother with that. This blog is about software development related ideas and thoughts which I think worth sharing publicly. I am planning to make the posts versatile enough, not focus entirely on any particular language, but I can not promise anything. I'll add new posts when I can, probably not that often, since _like I said_ I may have a life or something :)

I read somewhere that every blogger should have a great muse which encourages to generate content day by day. Well, I think mine is software craftsmanship. Sounds geeky, I know but the truth always boils down to the fact `This is a lifestyle, not a job`.
